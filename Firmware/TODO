- Support persistant configuration
	The goal of the feature is to make it possible handling next scenario: 
		- we set confofiguration where at pin, say, 10 default value is HIGH, 
			then, after watchdog hard reset, after restart, board configuration is loaded and that value (HIGH) 
			is set up. This would enable us, to support some default configuration.

- Add additional validations to configuration
